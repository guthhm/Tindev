# Tindev

This is a web and mobile application, based on Tinder, which helps developers to find a code partner based on their known programming languages and location.

It was inspired and based on (github.com/Rocketseat) Rocketseat's project, part of OmniStack week.

## Backend

The application uses a REST API model over a node.js server. For the Database structure, was used a schema-free structure on MongoDB with MongoDB Atlas as remote cluster.
